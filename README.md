# Plant-Disease-Detection-Model
A CNN based model that detects leaf diseases for farmers based on confidence scores.
Developed a plant disease detection model using convolutional neural networks (CNN) to classify leaf images into healthy or diseased categories. Incorporated confidence-based filtering to flag uncertain predictions as 'unknown' for safer decision-making.Deployed a lightweight, web-accessible tool for real-time detection
